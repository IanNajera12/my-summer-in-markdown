# my-summer-in-markdown

## A little bit about me, my name is Ian Najera, I am a senior at Chatsworth Charter High School and plan to attend a four year university, ideally UCLA.

### Summer Activities:
#### This summer I started my own window cleaning service since I was unable to find a part time job. So far it is going well and I've already made back my investment and then some.

### Summer Travel Experience:
#### This summer I was fortunate enough to visit France and Switzerland, in particular Geneva and a small city in France called Annecy. I was able to enjoy time with my family and relax. Additionally I also went to a family reunion in Maryland where I spent time with family I had not seen in years.

### Sports or Physical Activites:
#### While I used to be on the basketball team, I decided to quit in order to better myself in the gym and focus on myself rather than waste my time on a more recreational activity. Still I enjoyed using basketball as a source of cardio throughout summer as I would walk to the park to play by myself after I would go to the gym.

### Future Aspirations:
#### Some future aspirations I have are to finish my high school career strong. This means finishing school as a valedictorian and passing the few remaining AP exams I will be taking this year.

### Favorite Summer Memory with Friends:
#### Me and my friend Cyrus snuck into the Mariott hotel and were able to sit by the pool and enjoy time with each other.
